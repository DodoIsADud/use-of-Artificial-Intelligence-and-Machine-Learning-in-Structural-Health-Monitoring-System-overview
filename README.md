Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) involves using various technologies to assess and manage the condition of structures over time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated into SHM systems, providing several benefits for monitoring and maintaining the health of structures.
Some insightful features of how AI contributes to structural health monitoring are:
1. Sensor Data Processing: AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of sensor data collected from various monitoring devices such as accelerometers, strain gauges, and temperature sensors. This helps identify patterns, anomalies, and trends that may indicate structural issues.
2. Pattern Recognition: AI can recognize complex patterns in data that may be indicative of structural damage or deterioration. This is especially useful for identifying subtle changes that may not be apparent through traditional analysis methods.
3. Predictive Maintenance: AI can predict the future condition of a structure based on historical data and current conditions. By identifying potential issues before they become critical, maintenance activities can be planned more effectively, reducing downtime and repair costs.
4. Continuous Monitoring: AI systems can operate in real-time, providing continuous monitoring of structural conditions. This allows for immediate detection of anomalies and quick response to potential issues, enhancing the overall safety and reliability of structures.
5. Damage Identification: Machine learning algorithms can be trained to detect specific types of damage or structural deficiencies. This enables the system to automatically recognize and classify different types of issues, improving the accuracy and speed of diagnosis.
6. Sensor Fusion: AI can integrate data from a variety of sensors and sources, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of structural health. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with complex structures where multiple types of sensors are employed[Integration of IoT].
7. Remote Monitoring: AI facilitates remote monitoring, enabling engineers and maintenance personnel to assess the health of structures from a distance. This is especially valuable for structures in remote locations or difficult-to-access areas.
8. Efficient Resource Allocation: AI algorithms can analyze historical data to optimize inspection and maintenance schedules. By understanding when and where issues are likely to occur, resources can be allocated more efficiently, reducing costs and minimizing disruptions.
9. Risk Assessment: AI can assist in risk assessment by analyzing data and providing insights into potential risks associated with structural health. This information can guide decision-makers in prioritizing maintenance and repair activities.
10. Critical Error Margin Diagnosis: AI helps to critically assess and analyze various model efficiencies and outputs and helps in determining the error margin of any structural build-up
    value[flexural strength,Bending Moment,working stress,etc] with pin-point accuracy.


# Overview of Various Methods and Analysis of Structural Health Monitoring of Various Structures using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
# 1. Utilizing deep belief networks (DBNs)
The current transportation market, driven by a steady increase in global, is growing rapidly driven by a steady increase in the global economy, especially in developing countries. There is an urgent demand for constructing highways and railways in mountainous and cross-sea areas, where long-span bridges are widely built or in construction. Cable-supported bridges, including cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges, are widely used in highways crossing gorges, rivers, and gulfs, due to their superior structural mechanical property and beautiful appearance. A cable-supported bridge is usually the key junction of a highway or a railway demanding a higher safety margin. However, long-span bridges suffer from harsh environmental effects and complex loading conditions, such as heavy traffic loading, significant wind load effects, severe corrosion effects, and other natural disasters.

A cable-supported bridge has long-span flexible girders that increase the complexity of the structural mechanical behavior. In general, a cable-supported bridge has numerous failure modes. The critical failure modes are the bending moment failure of stiffening girders and cable rupture. The serviceability failure of a structural system derives from large deflections and severe vibrations. In this regard, the performance functions of the failure modes can be written as:
𝑍𝑖=1−𝑃𝑖(𝑿)𝑃𝑖u−𝑀𝑖(𝑿)𝑀𝑖u (𝑖=1,⋯,𝑚)
(1)
𝑍𝑗=𝑇𝑗u−𝑇𝑗(𝑿) (𝑗=1,⋯,𝑛)
(2)
𝑍u=𝑢max−𝑢(𝑿)

Naiwei and Yang et al. proposed a novel and intelligent approach for reliably evaluating the system of cable-supported
bridges under stochastic traffic load by utilizing deep belief networks (DBNs). They introduced the
theoretical basis for utilizing DBNs to approximate the structural load and presented a computational
framework to illustrate the procedures followed to evaluate the bridge system reliability via DBNs.

# 2. Using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method combined with the Hilbert–Huang transform method
Stay cables are important structural members of cable-stayed bridges, which play a significant role in the health monitoring and assessment of cable-stayed bridges. The in-service cable force, which varies from the effects of vehicle load, wind load and other environmental factors, may cause fatigue damage in stay cables. Hou et al.proposed a novel method for identifying time-varying cable tension based on the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. This recent method decomposes signals and adaptively estimates instantaneous frequencies combined with the Hilbert–Huang transform method, where the time-varying modal frequencies were identified from stay cable acceleration data, and then the time-varying cable tension was identified by the relationship between cable tension and identified fundamental frequency.The results showed that the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method has a good effect on identifying the time-varying cable forces, even the sudden changes in cable force. According to the cable force identification results, the maximum error was 8.4%, which meets the actual application of time-varying cable force measurements.Scaled and full-scale models of stay cables were implemented,and an on-site was also implemented to monitor the cable force during a construction period, and the results showed that the proposed method can provide accurate real-time results for evaluation and decision-making.


# 3. Uncertainty Handling in Structural Damage Detection Using Non-Probabilistic Meta-Model
Rapid progress in the field of sensor technology leads to the acquisition of massive amounts of measured data from structures being monitored. The data, however, contains inevitable measurement errors which often cause quantitative damage assessment to be ill-conditioned or flawed. Moreover, the probabilistic surrogate models involve complex and expensive computations, especially when generating output data. Ghiasi et al. proposed a novel approach as an alternative method to probabilistic schemes. In this approach, a non-probabilistic surrogate model based on wavelet weighted least squares support vector machine (WWLS-SVM) is considered and proposed to address the problem of uncertainty in vibration-based damage detection. The input data for WWLS-SVM consists of selected wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) features of the structural response signals, and the output is Young's modulus of structural elements. This method calculates the lower and upper boundaries of the changes in Young's modulus based on an interval analysis method. Considering the uncertainties in the input parameters, the surrogate model is used to predict the output of this interval bound. Applications involve detecting simulated damage in the four-story benchmark structure of the IASC-ASCE SHM group.

# 4. Damage Segmentation using VGG-Unet
The damages of the different components of a bridge may be very ordinary but strongly affect the functions of components. These components seriously influence the capacity of the bridge and even endanger the safety of the bridge. Thus, bridge management is becoming one of the major issues to keep their infrastructures esthetic and durable. The traditional method, manual inspection, according to the observed sizes and locations of damage [4], takes a lot of operation time, is expensive for the special inspection vehicles, and needs to constrain or stop the transportation. The innovative method of applying Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or robots could collect images quickly for civil infrastructures, and damage detection is available for some special structure members who are difficult to access by traditional manual inspection. Shi et al. proposed ways to improve the damage segmentation framework using two methods to train
VGG-Unet models. In this research, 200 corrosion images of steel and 500 crack images of rubber bearings are collected and manually labeled to build the data set. Then the two data sets are respectively adopted to train VGG-Unet models in two methods, aiming to conduct Damage Segmentation by inputting different sizes of data sets. One method is Squashing Segmentation to input squashed images from high resolution directly into the VGG-Unet model while Cropping Segmentation uses cropped images with size 224 × 224 as input images. Cropping Segmentation has a better result while for minor damage (such as a crack) segmentation, the result is the opposite.

# 5. InstaDam: Open-Source Platform for Rapid Semantic Segmentation of Structural Damage
The tremendous success of automated methods for the detection of damage in images of civil infrastructure has been fueled by exponential advances in deep learning over the past
decade. In particular, many efforts have taken place in academia and more recently in the industry that demonstrates the success of supervised deep learning methods for the semantic segmentation of damage (i.e., the pixel-wise identification of damage in images). However, from the detection of damage to applications such as inspection automation, efforts have been limited by the lack of large open datasets of real-world images with annotations for multiple types of damage, and other related information such as material and component types. In this study by Hoskere et al., the structure damage segmentation was used alongside an open-source software platform “InstaDam” for the fast pixel-wise annotation of damage by utilizing binary masks to aid user input. They described details of InstaDam’s software architecture and presented some of its key features. They also proposed several benefits of InstaDam by comparing it to the Image Labeler app in Matlab, and various comparisons were made between the InstaDam results. Moreover, experiments were conducted where two employed student annotators were given the task of annotating damage levels in a small dataset of images using Matlab. The benefits of InstaDam are explored by comparing it to the Image Labeler app in Matlab. Experiments are conducted where two employed student annotators are given the task of annotating damage in a small dataset of images using Matlab, InstaDam without IPTs, and InstaDam. Comparisons are made, quantifying the improvements in annotation speed and annotation consistency across annotators. A description of the statistics of the different IPTs used for different annotated classes is presented. The gains in annotation consistency and efficiency from using InstaDam will facilitate the development of datasets that can help to advance research into the automation of visual inspections.
